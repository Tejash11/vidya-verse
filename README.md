# **The problem Vidya Verse solves**
**Our education system** has numerous flaws which drains out the interest and enthusiasm of a student to explore and learn.

Normal school classes are monotonous due to which a student fails to visualize different concepts especially of science and eventually loses **interest in learning**.
Concerning these problems, we propose a stable solution.
We present **VidyaVerse** which will be a Revolutionary platform of **‘knowledge’ reality**.
We aim to level up the quality of education by enhanced **Augmented Reality visuals** and providing an edge over educational concepts.
Thereby we will introduce these concepts through **gamification** and AR Visuals, and to maintain the spirit of competition, we will be building a reward system with **VidyaCoins**.
VidyaVerse will be a **mobile application platform** for teachers, students and educational institutions which will enable sharing of AR study modules like AR chemistry to understand complex reactions, etc. and many more. It will feature **Gamified quizes** where teachers can design quizzes and students can play and compete with other peers.
VidyaVerse will be a full fledged platform where teachers will be able to deliver personalized content and track **student performance**.

When we look at **Covid-19** pandemic which has affected every single country in the world. Education was one of the most adversely affected part by this pandemic especially for the students of primary and middle schools as they had been missing their in person (offline) interactive classes and found it much difficult to connect to their teachers and the concepts taught by them. This not only affected their academics but also a big threat to the emerging minds of the future.

Even though e-learning has become a new normal for us, faculties and students are still facing loads of difficulties. Different online platforms are just trying to connect teachers and students but they are not able to take account of their learning and certainly not taking part in introducing Augmented Reality to make understanding easier.
